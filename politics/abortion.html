                <h1 id="what-is-abortion">What is abortion?</h1>
                Abortion is the act of terminating an unwanted pregnancy, for any reason. This should not be conflated
                with miscarriage, which is when the baby dies in the womb unintentionally. Some argue that this is a
                'fetus,' 'zygote,' or even a 'clump of cells,' the latter of which can explain literally all life on
                Earth.<br><br>
                Many arguments break down to a few medically necessary abortions, where the life of the mother is at
                risk. But, they use this argument to allow abortions for any reason at any time, including mere seconds
                before birth.<br><br>

                <h3 id="early-medical">Early and Medical</h3>
                This is the basic abortion pill that is often used before 9 weeks of gestation. While this can be a
                fairly benign process early on, it can end up being a crime scene inside the toilet later on due to
                development.<br>
                According to <a data-cite="2">WebMD</a>, it is important to remember that this is a prescribed process
                involving two medications, the first oral and the second is inserted into the vagina. Doctors often
                provide mifepristone or methotrexate as the first drug. It is a hormone that prevents the pregnancy from
                developing any further. A couple days later, you will take misoprostol through the vagina, which induces
                cramping and bleeding, almost like a period.<br>
                <br>
                <a data-cite="3">Methotrexate</a> should only be used when treating cancer or severe diseases caused
                by an overactive immune system, so its usage in abortion is beyond me. It is known to cause severe
                birth defects and even death. Since this is a chemotherapy, it is reasonable to assume that this drug
                works by inhibiting cell division throughout the body, meaning that some spills over into the baby
                and halting growth altogether.<br>
                <br>
                <a data-cite="4">Mifepristone</a> is a drug primarily used to induce contractions and other period-like
                symptoms, although these last for 9-16 days instead of the typical 2-7. Up to 8% of women have bleed
                for upwards of and even exceeding 30 days. 0.05% of women required transfusions.<br>
                <br>
                <a data-cite="5">Misoprostol</a> is a medication designed to prevent stomach ulcers while taking NSAIDs.
                It is also used to induce labor when inserted into the vagina, and is <b>NOT APPROVED<b> by the FDA to be
                used in this manner.<br>
                <br>
                <h3 id="simple-evactuation">Simple Evacuation</h3>
                A simple evacuation involves taking a vacuum-like device to literally suck the pregnancy out of the womb.
                These usually occur at or before 13 weeks as the child is still small enough to be removed in a single
                motion.<br>
                Simple evacuations are considered surgical operations. According to the <a data-cite="1">CDC</a>, 40%
                of all abortions were surgical abortions at or before 13 weeks of gestation, so I will assume this is
                a simple evacuation.<br>
                <br>
                <h3 id="dilation-and-evacuation">Dilation and Evacuation</h3>
                Unfortunately, 6.7% of all abortions involve extra steps beyond the simple evacuation. Because the baby
                is very large at this point, it is necessary to physically rip the arms and legs off the child. Many
                even include crushing the skull using a pair of medical grade tongs, called forceps.<br>
                Since 615,911 abortions were performed in 2020, that means a whopping 41,266 children were literally
                ripped apart in the womb for the sake of the mother.<br>
                <br>

                <h1 id="history">History</h1>
                I strongly suggest you read this section, as the Dobbs Decision makes clean work of Roe v. Wade,
                declaring it completely unfounded by anything and making short work of its claims.<br>
                <br>
                All throughout history, abortion has been a highly debated topic with varying levels of acceptance.
                Early restrictions were placed by the Catholic Church before appearing in secular law, citing that all
                life is sacred and abortion is murder of an innocent life. Even in the United States, abortion was
                considered illegal except in cases where the pregnancy directly threatened the life of the mother. I
                would argue most conservatives would agree with this sentiment, but I know that some will say that both
                lives are in the hands of God, and we shouldn't intervene.<br><br>
                However, <a data-cite="6">Roe v. Wade</a> of 1973 protected the "Constitutional right" to abortion,
                citing the right to privacy in the 4th amendment and <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>, protecting abortion
                at the federal level. This permitted the mother to abort her child for any reason during the first
                trimester, the state to add some regulations during the second, and the state to outlaw it during the
                third.<br>
                <br>
                In 2022, <a data-cite="7">Dobbs v. Jackson</a> of 2022 overturned the 1973 decision, claiming that the
                Constitutionality of those cases was wrongly decided.<br>
                The 1973 case cited the right to privacy (IV), the right to not incriminate yourself (V), other implied
                rights (IX) and the right to liberty (XIV) to state that we shouldn't know about any medical decisions
                anyway. However, newer decisions have disputed the relevancy of the 14th amendment, citing the Due
                Process clause or Equal Protection clause.<br>
                Since the right to liberty in the 14th amendment has been highly controversial and no new case has
                clarified the definition of "liberty," Dobbs looked into history and context of the 14th amendment,
                and found that the right to abortion was never recognized previously, so the "liberty" argument was
                tossed.<br>
                Dobbs also decided that due to the very grey line between "potential life" and an unwanted pregnancy,
                the line of ordered liberty, which separates public and private life, is also blurred, and the right
                to privacy can not be maintained.<br>
                Although not mentioned, it is obvious whether or not someone is pregnant after a couple months, so
                you incriminate yourself automatically by one day having a baby, and the next day not, so the right
                to not incriminate yourself as protected by the 5th amendment is not applicable.<br>
                Lastly, since there are no other rights to infer from, the 9th amendment is also not applicable.
                Therefore, Roe v. Wade was completely unfounded by anything, and all abortion restrictions should be
                passed back to the states. <b>The Dobbs Decision did not ban abortion</b>, it merely stated that this
                should not be addressed at a federal level.<br><br>
                Currently, this is a highly debated topic, mainly centering around the definition for a life and bodily
                autonomy. However, debating what rights we have as humans is a higher level argument, and we need to
                instead focus on who gives those rights; God or government.<br>

                <h1 id="common-myths">Common Myths</h1>
                <h3 id="lack-of-public-support">Lack of Public Support</h3>
                Many claim that most Americans were against the Dobbs Decision, but that's only because of the loudest
                group screaming about it. The overwhelming majority of Americans only defend early abortions because
                it's small and harmless, relatively speaking of course. And that is reflected in the original text of
                Roe v. Wade, as the federal government gave more power back to the states in later trimesters, even
                permitting the state to outlaw abortion entirely during the third trimester. Of course, most will
                defend abortion access when the mother's life is at risk.<br><br>
                <h3 id="contraception-will-be-banned">Contraception will be Banned</h3>
                Roe v. Wade never made any mentions of contraception at all. Dobbs v. Jackson actually brings this up
                several times, but ultimately rules that it is irrelevant to the case at hand, meaning contraceptives
                will be just as available as they always were.<br><br>
                <h3 id="more-dangerous-abortions">More Dangerous Abortions</h3>
                Current treatments are already not approved by the FDA to be used in abortions, so it is unsafe anyway.
                I've discussed the particular drugs used <a href="#early-medical">previously</a>.<br><br>
                <h3 id="loss-of-opportunity">Loss of Opportunity</h3>
                Many claim that women will not be able to control their lives or careers without abortion options. To
                which I ask, is it that difficult to abstain from sexual acts? You still have every right to do what
                you want as you did before, you just have to think about a condom before sleeping around.<br><br>
                <h3 id="foster-care-system">Foster Care System</h3>
                The Foster Care System is already an absolute mess and needs additional funding and reform. It is
                important to note, however, that Christian families are the most likely to adopt children and put up
                with the system.<br><br>
                <h3 id="maternal-mortality-rates">Maternal Mortality rates</h3>
                People claim that deaths due to pregnancy will skyrocket. To put it lightly, that is a blatant lie.
                According to the <a data-cite="10">CDC</a>, mothers have less than 0.0238% chance of dying from birth.
                I say 'less than' because that figure also includes the deaths from abortion.
                Across the entire USA in 2020, only 861 women were identified as having died from maternal causes. To
                put that into perspective, there are over 300 million Americans in the US; 861 is nothing.<br>
                Now, we do see a rising trend with maternal deaths, but that is due to being older and having high
                risk pregnancies. Rates rise nearly 500%, from 22.8 deaths per 100k births for mothers aged 25-39, to
                107.9 for mothers aged over 40.<br><br>
                <h3 id="criminalized-miscarriage">Criminalized Miscarriage</h3>
                Flat-out incorrect. Dobbs cites laws from several states that <i>medical providers</i>, should be punished
                for administering any procedure intended to procure the miscarriage of the child. These are important
                semantics here; the doctor is punished for causing the mother to miscarry, but the mother is never
                at fault here. Most laws actually protect abortions when used to save the mother's life, and every mention
                of miscarriage in these laws explicitly state that these are willingly produced. Dobbs makes no mention
                of how miscarriages should be handled beyond handing that power to the state.<br><br>
                <h3 id="pregnancy-tracking-stats">Pregnancy Tracking Stats</h3>
                I understand that women do not want their pregnancies to be tracked and potentially handed out to other
                apps. Android and iOS require explicit consent from the user to track health data, and each app has

                As stated previously, Dobbs makes no mention of how miscarriages should be handled. The overwhelming

                As stated previously, most, if not all, states already protect abortions when the life of the mother
                is at risk. It is up to her to still ask, however. This includes ectopic pregnancies.<br><br>

                As seen here, a baby mere 8 weeks old already has fully formed fingers and toes, even making fists and
                whatnot. There is no reason to say that this is 'your body.'<br><br>
                <h3 id="abortion-is-safe">Abortion is Safe</h3>
                To a point. Medicine-based abortion just starves the child and you push it out anyway. Surgical abortion
                involves tearing the child, limb by limb. Either way, you may have to visit the doctor again to remove
                some remnants of the child that used to be.<br>
                According to the <a data-cite="11">NHS</a>, only a "small number" of women suffer from pelvic infections
                after an abortion. However, they curiously neglect to mention the statistic they used to determine this
                "small number," unlike every other risk factor listed on the page. Therefore, I can only assume it is
                a bit more prevalent than they would like you to know. Pelvic infections also increase the risk of
                infertility and ectopic pregnancies, meaning an abortion could stop you from having your next child,
                should you ever want one.<br>
                <i>I am very familiar with Apple's "small percentage of users" gaslighting tactic, so I will refuse to
                believe any "small number" figure without any number next to it</i><br><br>
                <h3 id="dangerous-unlawful-abortions">Dangerous Unlawful Abortions</h3>
                Yes, unlawful abortions will be more dangerous, but that's because of the unsanitary environment. If the
                same process is used as in the doctor's office today, not much will change. If anything, it'll save
                more lives since you save $500 on each operation<br><br>
                <h3 id="a-fetus-is-not-a-person">A Fetus is Not a Person</h3>
                Fetus means unborn young. Embryo means a collection of cells of an animal or human. A zygote means an
                organism formed by the union of two gametes. All these are fancy terms for baby animal or human. They
                just abstract the definition to make it seem as if you aren't doing anything wrong. After your abortion,
                you'll likely never stop thinking about the child you never had. Go back to the my body my choice argument
                and tell me where it stops being a fetus and starts being a child.<br><br>
                <h3 id="undue-strain-on-families">Undue Stress on Families</h3>
                Yes, having a child causes stress. But it also brings much joy in the hours after. I can guarantee you that
                having a child will be the best experience of your life. You get to relive all your nostalgia, but through
                the eyes of your son or daughter instead of alone in your room. Even in the delivery room, your mind is
                racing through how fascinating life is. From nothing, mere months later, a life that lives in your
                footsteps.<br><br>
                <h3 id="restrictions-on-personal-freedoms">Restrictions on Personal Freedoms</h3>
                Your personal freedoms start where someone else's begins. That 'someone else' is the little baby who is
                going to open his eyes in only 9 months time.<br><br>
                <h1 id="history-of-planned-parenthood">History of Planned Parenthood</h1>
                According to the <a data-cite="12">Washington Post</a>,
                Margaret Sanger was a profound racist woman who supported eugenics, which aimed to improve the human race
                through planned breeding based on genetic traits. That's right, she tried to breed out minorities because
                she saw them as suboptimal. Then, Planned Parenthood, upon this revelation, decided to change history by
                scratching her name off as a founder. Today, more black babies are aborted than born in New York City:
                <a data-cite="13">TNEagleForum.org</a>.<br>
                Even more damning, <a data-cite="14">Planned Parenthood</a>'s own website neglects to define abortion,
                and promotes confusing and sexualizing children at young ages with 'gender identity.'
