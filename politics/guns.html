                It is clear that there are only two viable options: nobody gets guns, or everyone gets guns. Let's
                analyse the first option. America is the #1 manufacturer of guns, and arms the rest of the world.
                Therefore, guns will always be available on the black market, and "nobody gets guns" is no longer viable.
                So, we must arm everyone.<br><br>
                Now, there are claims that strict gun laws reduce gun deaths. This statement, while true, is confounded
                by the lack of guns on the streets. Of course, if there are no guns, there won't be gun deaths. Only
                an idiot would try to disprove that statement. However, we must look at other rates of homicide to conclude
                if guns are the issue.<br><br>

                It is a well-known fact that most gun-related homicides occur in areas that have strict gun laws.
                According to <a data-cite="1">this study</a> by WirePoints.org, the top 10 most violent
                cities are very liberal.

                Incredibly, the US black population managed to be <i>worse</i> than El Salvador. So, we must ask why are
                black people so much more violent than the rest of America? This appears to be linked to welfare and the
                lack of a nuclear family. When I eventually write that part of my 'blog,' I will link it here.<br>

                <h2 id="the-improper-solution">The Improper Solution</h2>
                Instead of very shallowly 'resolving' the issue by banning guns, we need to instead look at why people
                are violent. Guns do not kill people, people kill people, a gun is a tool. Violent people will be violent,
                with or without guns. In 1996, there was a mass shooting in Australia, and the Australian government
                subsequently banned guns. This was during a massive dip in homicides between 1993 and 2001, but there
                was a significant spike in 2001-2002.<br><br>
                While there has been an overall downward trend of domestic
                homicides and those between acquaintances, we cannot attribute this to the banning of guns due to a lack
                of data from before 1989; 7 years is not enough to find a trend. Moreover, the homicide rate between
                strangers has remained relatively stagnant, at 0.1-0.2 homicides per 100k.<br>

                Unfortunately, there is a misconception that assault-style weapons, such as the heavily cited AR-15, is
                a major factor behind all these crimes. That is simply not true. According to the <a data-cite="7">FBI</a>,
                hand guns are used in the overwhelming majority of crimes. In fact, next up after all guns is knives, which
                is used more often than rifles, shot guns and 'other guns' combined. AR-15's and AK-47's are classified
                as rifles.<br>

                A considerable proportion of crimes are committed with knives and other sharp objects, clearly it isn't
                out of the question for criminals. Again, from the <a data-cite="3">Australian government</a>, it shows
                that 37% of homicides in 2019-20 is a result of stab wounds. And hey, I thought they banned guns, but
                it still accounts for 13% of homicides. Curious, isn't it? People will still manage to get a hold of guns,
                regardless of legality.<br>

                Banning guns will do nothing to solve violent crime. We need to go to the root of the problem: why are
                people violent? Unfortunately, we have not been studying this and have no data on it. However, we can
                assume that there are several key signs that the shooting will happen before it does. We should start looking
                into this issue immediately.<br>
